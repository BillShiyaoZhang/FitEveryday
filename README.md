# Fit Everyday

Recently, I start doing 100 push-ups and sit-ups everyday. As I'm not good at fit, it's difficult for me to finish all of these at once.
So I record the number of push-ups and sit-ups I did each time. This is, however, not convenient as I need to count all those numbers.

This app tends to give user a better experience on counting push-ups and sit-ups. Hopefully, further support would be added.
